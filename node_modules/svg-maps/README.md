# SVG Maps

A set of SVG maps:
* [Australia](maps/australia)
* [France](maps/france)
* [Taiwan](maps/taiwan)
* [USA](maps/usa)

## Installation

`npm install --save svg-maps`

## SVG files

The SVG files come from different sources and have been cleaned to be more readable.

## JS files

The JS files contain a simplified object representation of the SVG files.

They are currently used by [react-svg-map](https://github.com/VictorCazanave/react-svg-map), but could be imported in any other project.

## Contribution
